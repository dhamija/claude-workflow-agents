# Claude Workflow Agents - Repository

> **Instructions for maintaining THIS repository.**
> **This file is NOT installed to user systems.**

---

## 🚨 CLAUDE: READ THIS FIRST

**Before making ANY changes to this repository:**

1. Read the [MANDATORY MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL](#️-mandatory-maintenance-protocol) section below
2. After changes to `agents/` or `commands/`, you MUST run `./scripts/verify.sh`
3. Do NOT commit until verify.sh passes - CI will fail otherwise

---

## ⚠️ Important Distinction

| This Repo | User Projects |
|-----------|---------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** (this file) | **templates/project/CLAUDE.md.template** |
| For maintaining workflow-agents | For user projects |
| NOT installed | Installed and customized |

**Never confuse repo files with user templates!**

---

## Installation Architecture

**Global-only model. No per-project enable/disable.**

### How It Works

1. **Install** (`install.sh`):
   - Downloads to `~/.claude-workflow-agents/`
   - Creates individual file symlinks in `~/.claude/agents/` and `~/.claude/commands/`
   - Claude Code automatically loads from `~/.claude/`
   - Workflow immediately active for all projects

2. **Enable/Disable** (`workflow-toggle on|off|status`):
   - **Global operation** - affects all Claude Code sessions
   - `on`: Creates individual file symlinks
   - `off`: Removes only workflow symlinks, preserves user's own files
   - `status`: Shows count of workflow symlinks

3. **Update** (`workflow-update`):
   - Pulls latest from git
   - Re-creates symlinks
   - Preserves user's own agents/commands

4. **Uninstall** (`workflow-uninstall`):
   - Removes workflow symlinks from `~/.claude/`
   - Removes `~/.claude-workflow-agents/` directory
   - Preserves user's own agents/commands

### Key Design Decisions

1. **No per-project control**: Claude Code loads agents globally from `~/.claude/`. Project-local agents don't work reliably.

2. **Individual file symlinks**: User's own agents/commands coexist with workflow files in same directories.

3. **No CLAUDE.md markers**: Earlier versions used `<!-- workflow: enabled -->` markers in project files. These were vestigial - Claude Code doesn't read them. Removed in v1.3.0.

4. **Global toggle only**: `workflow-toggle` affects all projects simultaneously. Cannot enable workflow for only some projects.

### User Experience

- **Install once**: `curl -fsSL ... | bash`
- **Use everywhere**: All projects immediately have access to workflow agents
- **Disable when not needed**: `workflow-toggle off` (global)
- **No per-project setup**: No need to run commands in each project

## 📋 Template Architecture (v1.0 - Self-Contained)

**CRITICAL DESIGN CHANGE:** As of v1.0, orchestration logic is self-contained in user project CLAUDE.md files.

### How Orchestration Works

#### Old Architecture (v0.9 - Broken) ❌

```
User Project CLAUDE.md
   ↓
   HTML comment: "READ workflow-orchestrator.md"
   ↓
   Hope Claude reads it
   ↓
   No enforcement → Can be ignored
```

**Problem:** Claude Code doesn't auto-read external files. HTML comments aren't enforced.

#### New Architecture (v1.0 - Self-Contained) ✓

```
Template: templates/project/CLAUDE.md.greenfield.template
   ↓
   Contains ALL orchestration logic embedded (750+ lines)
   ↓
   workflow-init generates → User Project CLAUDE.md
   ↓
   Self-contained, guaranteed to work
```

**Solution:** Orchestration logic embedded directly in templates. External agent files become optional reference documentation.

### Template Files

**Greenfield Template:** `templates/project/CLAUDE.md.greenfield.template` (793 lines)
- Complete L1 orchestration flow (Intent → UX → Architecture → Planning)
- Complete L2 orchestration flow (Backend → Frontend → Testing → Verification)
- Change request handling (change-analyzer integration)
- Issue response protocols (debugger, ui-debugger flows)
- Quality gates (automatic enforcement)
- Design principles (auto-applied)
- Workflow state tracking (YAML)
- Commands reference

**Brownfield Template:** `templates/project/CLAUDE.md.brownfield.template` (795 lines)
- Brownfield analysis flow (brownfield-analyzer)
- Gap analysis flow (gap-analyzer)
- Complete L2 orchestration (same as greenfield)
- Change request handling (same as greenfield)
- Issue response protocols (same as greenfield)
- Quality gates (same as greenfield)
- Design principles (same as greenfield)
- Workflow state tracking (YAML with analysis phase)

### Role of agents/*.md Files (Changed in v1.0)

**Previous (v0.9):** Required for operation. Claude expected to read these files.

**Current (v1.0):** Optional reference documentation for:
- Contributors understanding system architecture
- Users customizing behavior (reading detailed prompts)
- Debugging agent invocations
- System maintenance

**Exception:** `agents/workflow-orchestrator.md` is now **contributor documentation only**. It documents the orchestration system architecture for maintainers. It is NOT read by Claude during operation.

### How workflow-init Works

1. User runs `workflow-init` in project directory
2. Script detects greenfield (empty/new) or brownfield (existing code)
3. Script selects appropriate template:
   - `CLAUDE.md.greenfield.template` for new projects
   - `CLAUDE.md.brownfield.template` for existing codebases
4. Script replaces template variables:
   - `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` - from directory name or user input
   - `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}` - from user input
   - `{{DATE}}` - current date
   - `{{WORKFLOW_HOME}}` - `~/.claude-workflow-agents`
5. Script generates `CLAUDE.md` in project root
6. User project now has complete self-contained orchestration

### Template Maintenance

**When to update templates:**
- Adding/removing agents
- Changing orchestration flows
- Modifying quality gates
- Adding new workflow features

**After updating templates:**
1. Update `agents/workflow-orchestrator.md` (contributor docs)
2. Update this file (CLAUDE.md) if architecture changed
3. Run `./scripts/verify-docs.sh`
4. Test with `workflow-init` in test directory
5. Verify Claude follows new flow correctly
6. Commit all changes together

**Important:** Changes to templates do NOT automatically propagate to existing user projects. Users must run `workflow-update` (updates repo) and then `workflow-patch` (merges template changes into their CLAUDE.md).

### User Update Workflow

**Users have two commands for keeping their workflow up to date:**

#### 1. workflow-update (Update the Workflow System)

```bash
# From anywhere (updates the global installation)
workflow-update
```

**What it does:**
- Pulls latest changes from git repository
- Updates `~/.claude-workflow-agents/` with new agents, commands, templates
- Recreates symlinks if new agents/commands were added
- Detects if run from a project directory with CLAUDE.md
- Offers to run `workflow-patch` if updates affect orchestration

**When to run:**
- Periodically to get new features and bug fixes
- After seeing announcement of new workflow version
- When new agents/commands become available

#### 2. workflow-patch (Update Project CLAUDE.md)

```bash
# From project directory
cd /path/to/your/project
workflow-patch
```

**What it does:**
- Detects current CLAUDE.md version and type (greenfield/brownfield)
- Loads corresponding template from updated workflow system
- Extracts user sections (preserves your customizations):
  - Project name and description
  - Workflow state (progress, features, promises)
  - Project context (decisions, notes)
- Replaces template sections (updates orchestration logic):
  - Quick Reference tables
  - Session Start Protocol
  - L1/L2 Orchestration Flows
  - Issue Response Protocols
  - Quality Gates
  - Design Principles
  - Commands Reference
- Shows diff preview
- Requires confirmation
- Creates backup before applying

**Safety features:**
- Automatic backup: `CLAUDE.md.backup-<timestamp>`
- Diff preview before applying
- Can show detailed diff with `[D]` option
- Preserves all user customizations
- Aborts on any errors

**When to run:**
- After running `workflow-update` and seeing template changes
- When new orchestration features become available
- When quality gates or protocols are improved

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Update workflow system globally
workflow-update

# Output:
#   Updated: 0.9 → 1.0
#   Changes: New gap-analyzer flows, improved quality gates
#   Would you like to patch your CLAUDE.md? [Y/n/l]

# 2. Review and apply patches (if run from project directory)
# Or navigate to project and run manually:
cd ~/my-project
workflow-patch

# Shows diff preview:
#   - Old orchestration flows
#   + New orchestration flows
#
#   Apply patch? [Y/n/d]

# 3. Review changes
git diff CLAUDE.md

# 4. Test that orchestration still works
# Claude Code should now use updated flows

# 5. Delete backup if satisfied
rm CLAUDE.md.backup-20260126-143022
```

**Troubleshooting:**

If patch fails or produces unexpected results:

```bash
# Restore from backup
cp CLAUDE.md.backup-<timestamp> CLAUDE.md

# Report issue with:
# - Your CLAUDE.md version
# - Template version you tried to patch to
# - Error message or unexpected behavior
```

## Multi-Agent Workflow System

Multi-agent workflow system for Claude Code

## ⚠️ MANDATORY MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL: Claude MUST follow this protocol after ANY change to `agents/` or `commands/`.**

**See [Documentation Dependency Map](#-documentation-dependency-map) for complete file interdependencies.**

### Step-by-Step Checklist

When you add, modify, or remove ANY agent or command file:

1. ✅ **Update CLAUDE.md** (Current State section)
   - Update agent/command counts
   - Add new entries to the tables
   - Remove deleted entries

2. ✅ **Update commands/help.md**
   - Add new agents to appropriate section (L1/L2/Operations/Orchestration)
   - Update agent count in header ("THE X AGENTS")
   - Add new commands to the commands list

3. ✅ **Update README.md**
   - Update agent count (line ~124)
   - Update command count (line ~125)
   - Add new entries to agent/command tables

4. ✅ **Update templates/project/*.template** (CRITICAL!)
   - Add agent to "Agents Available" table in both greenfield and brownfield templates
   - Add trigger keywords to "Issue Detection Keywords" table if applicable
   - Add orchestration flow if it's a primary workflow agent (e.g., gap-analyzer, change-analyzer)
   - Update quality gates if agent requires automatic invocation
   - Update agents/workflow-orchestrator.md (contributor docs) to reflect changes

5. ✅ **Update tests**
   - `tests/structural/test_agents_exist.sh` - add to REQUIRED_AGENTS array
   - `tests/structural/test_commands_exist.sh` - add to REQUIRED_COMMANDS array
   - `tests/test_agents.sh` - add to REQUIRED_AGENTS array
   - `tests/test_commands.sh` - add to REQUIRED_COMMANDS array

6. ✅ **RUN VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify.sh
   ```

   **YOU MUST RUN THIS COMMAND BEFORE COMMITTING.**

   - If it fails, fix ALL reported issues immediately
   - Do NOT commit until verify.sh passes
   - Do NOT skip this step - CI will fail and block merges
   - **Check 7/7 specifically ensures workflow-orchestrator is in sync!**

7. ✅ **Update workflow commands in install.sh (if applicable)**

   If your changes affect the workflow commands, update the embedded scripts in `install.sh`:

   - **workflow-version** (line ~137-169)
     - Update commands list if new commands added
     - Update agent/command counts if changed

   - **workflow-update** (created in bin/workflow-update, installed by install.sh)
     - If update process changes
     - If new features need announcing

   - **workflow-patch** (created in bin/workflow-patch, installed by install.sh)
     - If patch logic changes
     - If section extraction needs updating

   - **Install success message** (line ~700-710)
     - Keep command list in sync with workflow-version output

   **Examples of when to update:**
   - Adding new agent → Update workflow-version commands list
   - New workflow command → Add to both workflow-version and install success
   - Changing template structure → Update workflow-patch logic

8. ✅ **Update STATE.md**
   - Add entry to Recent Changes section
   - Update component counts if changed
   - Update last updated timestamps

### Why This Matters

- **CI Enforcement**: `./scripts/verify.sh` runs in CI. PRs will be blocked if docs are out of sync.
- **User Experience**: Out-of-sync docs confuse users and break trust.
- **Automatic Detection**: The verify script catches 100% of sync issues before they reach users.

### Automation Helpers

To make this easier:

```bash
# After making changes, run:
./scripts/verify.sh

# If it passes, you're good to commit
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add new agent"

# If it fails, fix the reported issues and run again
```

### Failure Recovery

If you forgot to run verify.sh and CI fails:

1. Read the CI error output - it shows exactly what's missing
2. Fix the reported issues locally
3. Run `./scripts/verify.sh` to confirm
4. Commit the fixes
5. Push again

**Remember: verify.sh is your friend. It prevents mistakes, not creates them.**

## 📄 Documentation Dependency Map

**CRITICAL: These files must stay in sync when agents/commands change.**

### Primary Documentation Files

| File | Contains | Must Update When |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Repo maintenance, agent/command tables, counts | Any agent/command added/removed |
| **STATE.md** | Current state, agent/command lists, recent changes | Any agent/command added/removed, after major changes |
| **README.md** | User-facing docs, agent/command counts, tables | Any agent/command added/removed |
| **commands/help.md** | In-app help system, agent descriptions ("THE X AGENTS") | Any agent/command added/removed |
| **agents/workflow-orchestrator.md** | Orchestration logic, agent coordination, invocation table | **ANY agent/command added/removed/modified** |
| **AGENTS.md** | Detailed agent documentation | Agent capabilities change |
| **COMMANDS.md** | Detailed command documentation | Command behavior changes |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** workflow-orchestrator.md is the MOST IMPORTANT file to keep in sync! It coordinates all agents and must know about every single one.

### Cross-Reference Matrix

When you add/remove an agent, it must be updated in:

1. ✅ **CLAUDE.md** - Current State section → Agents table
2. ✅ **STATE.md** - Agents List table + Component Counts
3. ✅ **README.md** - "The X Agents" section + table
4. ✅ **commands/help.md** - "THE X AGENTS" header + agent sections (L1/L2/Operations/Orchestration)
5. ✅ **agents/workflow-orchestrator.md** - "Agents Coordinated" section + invocation table
6. ✅ **tests/structural/test_agents_exist.sh** - REQUIRED_AGENTS array
7. ✅ **tests/test_agents.sh** - REQUIRED_AGENTS array

**CRITICAL: workflow-orchestrator.md must list ALL agents it coordinates!**
- When adding an agent, add it to the appropriate category (L1/L2/Support/Operations)
- Update the "When to Invoke Each Agent" table
- Add orchestration flow if it's a primary workflow agent

When you add/remove a command, it must be updated in:

1. ✅ **CLAUDE.md** - Directory Structure comment (count)
2. ✅ **STATE.md** - Component Counts
3. ✅ **README.md** - Commands count
4. ✅ **commands/help.md** - Commands section (if user-visible)
5. ✅ **tests/structural/test_commands_exist.sh** - REQUIRED_COMMANDS array
6. ✅ **tests/test_commands.sh** - REQUIRED_COMMANDS array

### Workflow Command Scripts

**When you add/modify workflow commands (workflow-*, bin/*), update:**

| Script Location | What to Update | When |
|-----------------|----------------|------|
| **install.sh** (line ~137-169) | `workflow-version` embedded script | New command added, agent/command counts changed |
| **install.sh** (line ~700-710) | Install success message commands list | New command added |
| **bin/workflow-update** | Update logic, change detection | Update process changes, new features |
| **bin/workflow-patch** | Section extraction, merge logic | Template structure changes, new sections |
| **README.md** | Terminal commands table, updating section | New command added, behavior changes |

**Examples:**
- **Add new command** → Update workflow-version output + install.sh success message + README.md
- **Add agent** → Update workflow-version if affects command list
- **Change templates** → Update workflow-patch section extraction logic
- **Add feature** → Update workflow-update to announce it

**Why this matters:**
- workflow-version is the first thing users run to check their installation
- Out-of-sync command lists confuse users
- workflow-patch must know template structure to preserve user data

### Verification System

The `./scripts/verify.sh` script automatically checks (7 checks):

✓ **[1/7]** Agent counts consistent (CLAUDE.md, STATE.md, README.md, help.md)
✓ **[2/7]** Command counts consistent (CLAUDE.md, STATE.md, README.md)
✓ **[3/7]** All agents referenced in CLAUDE.md
✓ **[4/7]** All agents referenced in help.md
✓ **[5/7]** All agents in test files
✓ **[6/7]** All commands in test files
✓ **[7/7]** All agents in STATE.md agents list
✓ **[7/7]** **workflow-orchestrator knows all agents it coordinates**

**NEW:** Check 7 ensures the orchestrator stays in sync when agents change!

**If verify.sh passes, your docs are in sync. If it fails, follow the error messages.**

### Documentation Categories

## What This Is

A multi-agent workflow system. Users describe what they want, Claude orchestrates specialized agents to build it.

**Two-level workflow:**
- L1 (once): Understand → Design → Plan
- L2 (per feature): Build → Test → Verify
