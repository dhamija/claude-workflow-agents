description: Analyze current project and suggest agentic optimizations
argument-hint: <optional focus area>
---

Use the agentic-architect subagent to:

1. Read and understand the current codebase:
   - Read CLAUDE.md, README.md, and /docs/ if they exist
   - Explore /src or /api and /web directories
   - Understand the current architecture and data flow

2. Analyze through an agentic lens:
   - What is currently hardcoded that could be an agent decision?
   - Where are brittle heuristics/rules that LLMs could handle better?
   - What manual processes could become agent workflows?
   - Where is there implicit "intelligence" buried in if/else chains?

3. Propose agentic optimizations:
   - Which components should become agents?
   - Which should stay as traditional code?
   - What new agents could add capabilities?
   - What's the migration path (not just ideal end state)?

4. Risk assessment:
   - Where would adding agents make things WORSE?
   - What's not ready for agents yet?
   - What would break during migration?

Focus area (if specified): $ARGUMENTS

Save analysis to /docs/architecture/agentic-audit.md
```

**Usage:**
```
/aa food delivery app                    # New project
/aa-audit                                # Analyze current project
/aa-audit the notification system        # Focus on specific area
