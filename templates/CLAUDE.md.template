## Product Intent

This project implements the intent defined in `/docs/intent/product-intent.md`.

**Core Promise:** [One sentence describing the main user promise]

**Key Invariants:**
- [Invariant 1]
- [Invariant 2]

See full intent document for complete promises and behavioral contracts.

## User Journeys

The UX is designed around journeys documented in `/docs/ux/user-journeys.md`.

**Primary Journeys:**
1. [Journey 1]
2. [Journey 2]
3. [Journey 3]

## Agent Components

[If this project uses AI agents, describe them here]

**Agents:**
- [Agent name]: [purpose]

**Traditional Code:**
- [Component]: [why it's not an agent]

See `/docs/architecture/agent-design.md` for complete architecture.

## Workflow Integration

This project uses Claude Workflow Agents. The workflow commands are:

**Greenfield:**
- `/analyze` - Run analysis agents
- `/plan` - Generate implementation plans
- `/implement` - Build phase by phase
- `/verify` - Verify correctness

**Brownfield:**
- `/audit` - Understand current state
- `/gap` - Analyze gaps
- `/improve` - Fix gaps incrementally

**Quality:**
- `/review` - Code review
- `/debug` - Debug issues

See [claude-workflow-agents](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-workflow-agents) for complete documentation.
