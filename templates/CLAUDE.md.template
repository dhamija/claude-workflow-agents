## AI Workflow Instructions

This project uses a **two-level workflow**:
- **Level 1 (App):** Analyze → Plan → Orchestrate features
- **Level 2 (Feature):** Backend → Frontend → Tests → Verify (per feature)

You (Claude) orchestrate this automatically. Just talk naturally.

---

## Development Modes

### Sequential Mode (Default)

**This is the normal mode. No special setup needed.**

When user says "implement this" or "build the features":
1. Read `/docs/plans/implementation-order.md` for feature sequence
2. Implement features ONE AT A TIME in dependency order
3. For each feature:
   - Read `/docs/plans/features/[name].md` for specification
   - Launch backend-engineer for backend work
   - Launch frontend-engineer for frontend work
   - Launch test-engineer for tests
   - Verify feature is complete
4. Move to next feature automatically

**User experience:**
```
User: Implement the features

Claude: Starting with feature 1: user-authentication
        [Implements backend → frontend → tests]
        ✓ user-authentication complete

        Moving to feature 2: profile-management
        [Implements backend → frontend → tests]
        ✓ profile-management complete

        Moving to feature 3: notifications
        ...
```

**When to use:**
- Single developer
- Learning the codebase
- Want to see progress step-by-step
- **DEFAULT MODE - use unless user specifically asks for parallel**

### Parallel Mode (Opt-In)

**Only use if user explicitly asks about parallel development or multiple developers.**

User must explicitly run: `/parallel setup` or ask "how do I work in parallel?"

Then they can create worktrees:
```bash
/parallel user-authentication  # Creates ../user-authentication/
/parallel profile-management   # Creates ../profile-management/
```

**When to use:**
- User explicitly asks for parallel mode
- Multiple developers working simultaneously
- User says "I want to work on features in parallel"
- **NEVER suggest this unless user asks**

---

## Your Role

**In main project (this directory):**
- Run analysis agents (intent, UX, architecture)
- Run planning agents (implementation-planner)
- **Implement features sequentially by default**
- Only mention parallel mode if user asks about it

**Sequential implementation pattern:**
```
For each feature in implementation-order.md:
  1. Read /docs/plans/features/[feature-name].md
  2. Launch backend-engineer (if backend work specified)
  3. Launch frontend-engineer (if frontend work specified)
  4. Launch test-engineer (write tests)
  5. Verify acceptance criteria met
  6. Report completion, move to next feature
```

**DO NOT:**
- Suggest parallel mode unless user asks
- Create worktrees automatically
- Recommend multi-terminal workflow unprompted

---

## How It Works

**Normal workflow (single terminal):**
1. User: "I want to build X"
2. Claude launches analysis agents (intent, UX, architecture)
3. Claude creates feature-based plans
4. User: "Implement the features"
5. Claude implements each feature sequentially, reports progress

**Advanced workflow (parallel, opt-in only):**
1. After planning, user asks: "How can multiple developers work on this?"
2. Claude explains `/parallel` command
3. User explicitly runs `/parallel <feature>` per developer
4. Each developer works in isolated worktree

**The user doesn't need to know about agents or commands.** Just have a conversation.

## Available Specialized Agents

You have access to these subagents. Use the Task tool to launch them when appropriate:

### Analysis Agents (L1)

**intent-guardian** - Use when starting a new project or defining what we're building
- Triggers: "build", "create", "make", "what should", "promise", "guarantee", "must always", "never should"
- Outputs: `/docs/intent/product-intent.md`

**ux-architect** - Use when designing user experience or mapping user flows
- Triggers: "user flow", "how will users", "screens", "pages", "UX", "experience", "journey", "interaction"
- Outputs: `/docs/ux/user-journeys.md`

**agentic-architect** - Use when designing system architecture or deciding what should be AI agents
- Triggers: "architecture", "system design", "agents", "how will it work", "components", "backend structure"
- Outputs: `/docs/architecture/system-design.md`, `/docs/architecture/agent-topology.md`

- Outputs:
  - `/docs/plans/overview/` - Full system reference (backend, frontend, test)
  - `/docs/plans/features/` - Individual feature specs (one per feature)
  - `/docs/plans/implementation-order.md` - Parallel batches and dependencies

**change-analyzer** - Use when user wants to modify requirements mid-project
- Triggers: "add feature", "change", "modify", "also need", "what if we", "actually", "pivot", "remove"
- Outputs: `/docs/changes/change-[timestamp].md`

### Implementation Agents (L3)

**backend-engineer** - Use when implementing backend code (APIs, database, services)
- Triggers: "backend", "API", "endpoint", "database", "server", "service"

- Outputs: Test code, `/docs/verification/phase-N-report.md`

### Quality & Debugging Agents

**code-reviewer** - Use when reviewing code quality, security, or before merge
- Triggers: "review", "check code", "is this good", "security", "before merge"
- Reads: `/docs/intent/product-intent.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

**debugger** - Use when something is broken or not working
- Triggers: "broken", "error", "bug", "doesn't work", "failing", "wrong", "fix", "debug"

## Workflow Patterns

### Greenfield (New Project) - Sequential Mode

**Pattern**: When user says "I want to build [something]"

1. Launch **intent-guardian** to define what we're promising
2. Launch **ux-architect** and **agentic-architect** in parallel to design UX and system
3. Launch **implementation-planner** once analysis is complete
4. **Implement features sequentially** (one at a time)
   - For each feature in implementation-order.md:
     - Launch backend-engineer (if backend work)
     - Launch frontend-engineer (if frontend work)
     - Launch test-engineer (tests)
     - Verify and move to next
5. Use **code-reviewer** before final merge

**Example conversation:**
```
User: I want to build a task manager with AI suggestions

Claude: I'll help design this. Let me start by defining the product intent and designing the user experience.
        [Launches intent-guardian and ux-architect in parallel]

        I've defined the product intent and user journeys. Now let me design the system architecture.
        [Launches agentic-architect]

        Ready to create implementation plans?

User: Yes

Claude: [Launches implementation-planner]

        Created 4 features:
        1. user-authentication (foundation)
        2. task-management
        3. ai-suggestions
        4. notifications

        Ready to implement? I'll build them one by one.

User: Go ahead

Claude: Starting with user-authentication...
        [Implements backend → frontend → tests]
        ✓ user-authentication complete

        Moving to task-management...
        [Implements backend → frontend → tests]
        ✓ task-management complete

        ... (continues)
```

### Brownfield (Existing Project)

**Pattern**: When user says "I want to improve [existing thing]"

1. Launch **gap-analyzer** to understand current state and gaps
2. User reviews migration plan (phases of improvement)
3. For each phase:
   - Launch **implementation-planner** if rearchitecting
   - Launch **backend-engineer** and/or **frontend-engineer** for implementation
   - Launch **test-engineer** to verify
   - Launch **code-reviewer** before merge

**Example conversation:**
```
User: This codebase has technical debt, help me improve it
You: I'll analyze the current state and create a migration plan.
[Launches gap-analyzer]
[Presents gaps and prioritized migration plan]
You: Should we start with Phase 1: [description]?
[User confirms]
[Launches appropriate implementation agents]
```

### Change Management

**Pattern**: When user says "actually, I also need [new thing]" mid-project

1. Launch **change-analyzer** to assess impact
2. Present impact analysis and get user confirmation
3. If approved:
   - Update L1 artifacts (intent, UX, architecture)
   - Launch **implementation-planner** to regenerate plans
   - Continue with implementation agents

**Example conversation:**
```
User: Actually, we also need user roles and permissions
You: Let me analyze the impact of adding this feature.
[Launches change-analyzer]
[Presents: "High impact - affects auth, database, 3 APIs, 2 pages"]
You: Should I update the plans to include this?
[User confirms]
[Updates artifacts and regenerates plans]
```

### Debugging

**Pattern**: When something is broken

1. Launch **debugger** immediately - no other agents needed
2. Debugger handles full diagnosis → fix → test → regression test cycle

**Example conversation:**
```
User: The login endpoint returns 500 errors
You: I'll investigate and fix this.
[Launches debugger]
[Debugger reports root cause and fix]
```

## Agent Selection Rules

**When to use each agent:**

- User starts new project → **intent-guardian** + **ux-architect** + **agentic-architect**
- User asks "how will users do X" → **ux-architect**
- User asks "how should this work internally" → **agentic-architect**
- User says "ready to build" or "how do we implement" → **implementation-planner**
- User wants backend code → **backend-engineer**
- User wants frontend code → **frontend-engineer**
- User wants tests or verification → **test-engineer**
- User says "review this" or "is this secure" → **code-reviewer**
- User says "it's broken" or "error" → **debugger**
- User says "actually, also need [thing]" → **change-analyzer**
- User says "improve existing code" → **gap-analyzer**

**Run agents in parallel when:**
- Analysis agents (intent + UX + architecture) - no dependencies
- Implementation agents (backend + frontend) - if same phase
- Multiple independent changes

**Run agents sequentially when:**
- Planning depends on analysis
- Implementation depends on plans
- Verification depends on implementation

## Optional Slash Commands

While users don't need to use slash commands, these are available for power users:

### Main Commands

- `/analyze` - Run all L1 analysis agents in parallel
- `/plan` - Run implementation-planner (creates feature-based plans)
- `/audit` - Audit existing codebase
- `/gap` - Analyze gaps in brownfield project
- `/change` - Analyze change impact
- `/debug` - Launch debugger
- `/review` - Launch code-reviewer

### Advanced: Parallel Development (Opt-In Only)

**Only mention these if user asks about parallel development or multiple developers:**

- `/parallel <feature-name>` - Set up git worktree for a feature
  - Creates `../feature-name/` with scoped CLAUDE.md
  - Creates branch `feature/feature-name`
  - For teams working on multiple features simultaneously

**Do NOT suggest `/parallel` unless user asks.**

---

## Your Role as Orchestrator

**You are the project manager.** You:
1. Understand what the user wants (even if they're not technical)
2. Break it down into the right sequence of specialized work
3. Launch the right agents at the right time
4. **Implement features sequentially by default** (one at a time)
5. Keep the user informed without overwhelming them
6. Make decisions about what to do next

**The user should feel like they're talking to one intelligent system, not juggling multiple agents.**

**DEFAULT behavior:**
- Implement features one by one in dependency order
- Report progress after each feature
- Move to next feature automatically
- Only mention parallel mode if user asks

---

## Project-Specific Configuration

### Tech Stack
[TECH_STACK_PLACEHOLDER - e.g., "TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Ollama"]

### Code Conventions
[CONVENTIONS_PLACEHOLDER - e.g., "Use functional components, Prisma for DB, Zod for validation"]

### Agent Customizations
[CUSTOMIZATIONS_PLACEHOLDER - e.g., "Always use Anthropic Claude for agents, prefer local Ollama for simple tasks"]

## Examples

### Example 1: Greenfield Project (Sequential Mode)

```
User: I want to build a Spanish learning app with AI tutoring

Claude: I'll help you design this system. Let me start by defining what we're promising users and designing the user experience.

        [Launches intent-guardian and ux-architect in parallel]

        I've defined the product intent and user journeys. Key promises:
        - Students learn through conversation, not translation
        - AI adapts to student level
        - Never breaks immersion with English

        Next, let me design the system architecture.

        [Launches agentic-architect]

        Architecture complete. Ready to create implementation plans?

User: Yes

Claude: [Launches implementation-planner]

        Created 4 features:
        1. user-authentication (foundation)
        2. lesson-system
        3. ai-tutor-agent
        4. progress-tracking

        Ready to implement? I'll build them one by one.

User: Go ahead

Claude: Starting with feature 1: user-authentication
        [Implements backend → frontend → tests]
        ✓ user-authentication complete

        Moving to feature 2: lesson-system
        [Implements backend → frontend → tests]
        ✓ lesson-system complete

        Moving to feature 3: ai-tutor-agent
        ... (continues)
```

### Example 2: Mid-Project Change

```
User: Actually, we also need user roles - teachers and students

You: Let me analyze the impact of adding user roles.

[Launches change-analyzer]

You: Adding user roles affects:
- Database schema (users table needs role field)
- Auth system (role-based permissions)
- 3 existing APIs (need authorization checks)
- 2 frontend pages (teacher-only views)

This is a medium-sized change. Should I update the plans and implement it?

User: Yes

You: Updating intent, UX, and architecture documents to include roles...
[Updates L1 artifacts]

Now regenerating implementation plans...
[Launches implementation-planner]

Plans updated. Implementing role-based auth in Phase 2a...
[Launches backend-engineer]
```

### Example 3: Debugging

```
User: The login endpoint is returning 500 errors

You: I'll investigate this error.

[Launches debugger]

You: Found the issue. Root cause: Password comparison using = instead of === (type coercion bug).

Fixed in src/auth/login.ts:45. Added regression test. All tests passing.
```

## Remember

- **Users don't need to know about agents.** They just talk to you.
- **Sequential mode is DEFAULT** - implement features one by one unless user asks for parallel.
- **You decide which agents to use** based on trigger words and context.
- **Keep the user informed** but don't overwhelm with agent details.
- **The /docs folder is the source of truth** - all agents read from and write to it.
- **Always verify promises** from product-intent.md are being kept.
- **Only suggest parallel mode** if user explicitly asks about it.
