# Feature: [FEATURE_NAME]

> **Scoped worktree** - This is a feature-specific development environment.
>
> **Your job:** Implement this feature according to `FEATURE.md`
>
> **Do NOT:** Run analysis or planning agents (already done in main project)

---

## Your Mission

Implement the feature defined in `FEATURE.md`:
1. Read `FEATURE.md` for complete specification
2. Implement backend, frontend, and tests as specified
3. Verify acceptance criteria are met
4. Run tests and code review
5. Push when ready for PR

---

## Available Agents

You have access to **implementation and quality agents only**.

### Implementation Agents

**backend-engineer** - Implement backend code
- Triggers: "backend", "API", "endpoint", "database", "server"
- Use for: APIs, services, database work

**frontend-engineer** - Implement frontend code
- Triggers: "frontend", "UI", "component", "page"
- Use for: Pages, components, state management

**test-engineer** - Write tests and verify
- Triggers: "test", "verify", "check"
- Use for: Unit, integration, E2E tests

### Quality Agents

**code-reviewer** - Review code quality and security
- Triggers: "review", "check code", "is this good"
- Use before pushing

**debugger** - Debug and fix issues
- Triggers: "broken", "error", "bug", "fix"
- Use when something doesn't work

## Workflow

### 1. Understand Scope

```
You: Show me what I need to implement

Claude: [Reads FEATURE.md]

        This feature requires:

        Backend:
        - 3 API endpoints in /api/profiles
        - ProfileService with CRUD operations
        - Integration tests

        Frontend:
        - ProfilePage component
        - ProfileEditor component
        - API integration

        Tests:
        - Unit tests for validation
        - Integration tests for API
        - E2E test for edit flow
```

### 2. Implement

```
You: Implement the backend

Claude: [Launches backend-engineer]

        Created:
        - backend/src/profiles/routes.ts
        - backend/src/profiles/service.ts
        - backend/src/profiles/validation.ts

        All endpoints implemented per spec.

You: Now the frontend

Claude: [Launches frontend-engineer]

        Created:
        - frontend/src/features/profiles/ProfilePage.tsx
        - frontend/src/features/profiles/ProfileEditor.tsx
        - frontend/src/features/profiles/api.ts
```

### 3. Verify

```
You: Run the tests

Claude: [Launches test-engineer]

        ✓ 5 backend tests passing
        ✓ 4 frontend tests passing
        ✓ 1 E2E test passing

        All acceptance criteria met.

You: Review the code

Claude: [Launches code-reviewer]

        Code looks good. No security issues.
        One suggestion: Add error boundary.
```

### 4. Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement [FEATURE_NAME]"
git push origin feature/[FEATURE_NAME]
```

## What NOT to Do

**Don't run analysis agents:**
- ❌ intent-guardian
- ❌ ux-architect
- ❌ agentic-architect

**Don't run planning agents:**
- ❌ implementation-planner
- ❌ gap-analyzer

**Why:** Analysis and planning already done in main project. This worktree is for **execution only**.

---

## Feature Specification

See `FEATURE.md` for:
- Complete scope
- Exact file paths to create
- Backend specifications
- Frontend specifications
- Test requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies

---

## Acceptance Criteria

Before pushing, verify ALL criteria in `FEATURE.md` are met:
- [ ] All specified files created
- [ ] All API endpoints working
- [ ] All UI components rendering
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

---

## Project Context

### Tech Stack
[TECH_STACK_PLACEHOLDER]

### Code Conventions
[CONVENTIONS_PLACEHOLDER]

### Testing Strategy
- Backend: Jest for unit/integration tests
- Frontend: React Testing Library
- E2E: Playwright or Cypress

## When You're Done

1. **Verify all tests pass**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Review your own code**
   ```
   You: Review all the code I just wrote
   Claude: [Launches code-reviewer with full scope]
   ```

3. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/[FEATURE_NAME]
   # Create PR on GitHub to merge into main
   ```

4. **Clean up (after PR merged)**
   ```bash
   cd ../main-project
   git worktree remove ../[FEATURE_NAME]
   git pull origin main
   ```

---

## Parallel Development

Other developers may be working on other features simultaneously in their own worktrees:
- `../profile-management/`
- `../notification-system/`
- `../social-feed/`

**Stay in your lane:**
- Only modify files specified in your `FEATURE.md`
- Don't touch files from other features
- If you need shared code, coordinate before creating it

**Merge conflicts:**
- Unlikely if features are properly scoped
- If conflict occurs, resolve and retest

---

## Getting Help

**If blocked by dependencies:**
```
You: This feature depends on user-authentication but it's not merged yet

Claude: According to FEATURE.md, this feature has dependencies.
        You should wait for those features to merge before continuing.

        Or you can mock the dependencies for now and update after merge.
```

**If scope is unclear:**
```
You: The feature plan doesn't specify how to handle error state X

Claude: Let's add that to the feature. I'll implement reasonable
        error handling and document it for the PR description.
```

**If tests are failing:**
```
You: Tests are failing after my changes

Claude: [Launches debugger]
        Found the issue: [explains root cause]
        [Fixes and reruns tests]
```

## Remember

- **You're building ONE feature** - Stay focused on FEATURE.md scope
- **Tests are required** - No feature is complete without tests
- **Code quality matters** - Always review before pushing
- **Communicate** - If you deviate from the plan, document why
